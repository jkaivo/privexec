\begin{abstract}
The discovery of exploitable bugs in critical security components such as
\texttt{sudo} happens with alarming frequency. Complexity of the SUID binary
plays a significant part in allowing these bugs to exist in the first place.
This paper presents a much simpler replacement for \texttt{sudo} which
separates the different stages of privilege elevation into separate processes,
only the last of which is fully elevated.
